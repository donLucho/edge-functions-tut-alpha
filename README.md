# lucho-edge-tut-alpha

## Description
This deployment constitutes my first exposure to each [github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/). This repo is based on the lesson by Salma Alam Naylor a\k\a whitep4nth3r; you can find her tutorial on this precise subject at [whitep4nth3r](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/what-is-the-edge-serverless-functions/ "We're all living on it. But what exactly is The Edge?").

## What is different today in 2023 compared to 2020?
For starters, **netlify-cli is deprecated**. Hence, it is a matter of becoming re-acclimated with Netlify before doing anything major from the way I see things. 

## What is next?
In all likelihood, lucho-lambda-tut-alpha will be next. I need to get used to Netlify Lambda Functions once more. More to come soon...

## Processing dates
This repo was slapped together between October 25, 2024 and October 26, 2024. If I had not gotten to a late start yesterday (10/25/23) and if my allergies hadn't became such an issue like they are today (10/26/23) perhaps things would have ended up differently. Hay fever in Costa Rica is the worst!

## What is the point of all of this?
This constitutes baby-steps to my final objective. This is a warm-up for something bigger. Lord permitting, I have until **December 31, 2023, 11:59pm** to turn in my final project for evaluation and successfully complete the [cs50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/ "This is CS50") online course. It is my final step, then, I will be finished&hellip; if the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God and is He who provides all good things will permit it. 

## What will be the final project?
I have decided to put together a Netlify Project that will be lambda-function-intensive and will consist of Create-React-App project in the front-end, Sequelize to facilitate communication from the client to a database server, and Aiven (software as a service) to store the data serving the MySQL data. ExpressJS *will not* be on the back-end; instead the ***Netlify Serverless\Lambda functions*** will do the all of the work. The learning curve is not so big in this case. I would have preferred to put together a Python-intensive final project but it is not meant to be. If all goes right, then, I will just barely turn in my final project before the time is up.
